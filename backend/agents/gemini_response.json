"The video opens with a warning about violent content. We then see three men on a city street. Two men are attacking the third man, who is lying on the ground.  The third man is wearing red pants with gold accents and a red shirt. Both of the men attacking the third man are wearing casual clothing. The man in the front is wearing white shorts and a white t-shirt.  He is using a white and black patterned bag to hit the man on the ground. The man in the back is wearing black pants and a black shirt. He is kicking the man on the ground. There are several people walking in the background.  There is a red car and a white bus stopped in the background.  The bus has a sign on the side that reads \"RTA.\"  The video appears to be filmed from inside a car. The driver's side door is open and you can see the door handle of the car and a pen on the windshield. The camera is shaking and there are many different sounds of the men fighting, their voices, and traffic. There is no music in the background.  There is a stop sign in the background and a bus stop with a phone booth.  The third man is able to get up and run away from the two men. He runs across the street and the man in the black shirt gives chase.  The man in the black shirt catches up to the man in the red pants and the video ends. \n"
